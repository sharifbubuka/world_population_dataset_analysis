# INVESTIGATION OF THE WORLD POPULATION DATASET

![TMDB Movies](world-map.jpg)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In this Dataset from <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com">worldpopulationreview.com</a>, we have historical population data for every country in the world by different parameters like Area Size of the Country/Territory, Name of the Continent, Name of the Capital, Density, Population Growth Rate, Ranking based on Population, World Population Percentage, etc. In this project, i will investigate a subset of this database using popular python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, among others, in order to answer the following 10 questions:

<ol>
    <li>Which continent had the highest average population growth rate between 1990 and 2020?</li>
    <li>What was the average decline in population growth between 1970 and 2000?</li>
    <li>Which countries exhibit outlier-like behavior in terms of their population growth rates?</li>
    <li>What is the average population growth of African countries? How does it compare to other continents?</li>
    <li>Compare the population growth rates of African countries with those of Asian countries.</li>
    <li>Which 2 continents constitute the smallest global population percentage?</li>
    <li>Find two countries that exhibited outlier-like behavior in their population growth between 1980 and 2020.</li>
    <li>Investigate the continental relationship between a country’s population growth and population density.</li>
    <li>Explore the correlation between a country’s land area and its population growth in the last three decades.</li>
    <li>Determine the net population growth of the 20 biggest countries in the world between 1980 and 2015.</li>
</ol>

First and foremost, I configure my working environment. I then collect the raw data from an CSV file. I wrnagle the data - in order to ascertain its structural and contextual state. Based on the findings from the wrnagling phase as well as the context of the analysis questions, I clean the data - drop and rename columns. I go ahead to perform both exploratory and explanatory analysis on a copy of the cleaned dataset. Lastly, I share my findings as well as the resources and references used throughout the project.
